<!-- Part II
In info.html complete the following:
Create three containers [ <div> ] that will resemble three “rows” of content
Provide these rows with a class names to identify that they are a row [ class=”” ]
Provide these rows with an extra class name that will identify each individual row, and whether it is “image-left” or “image-right”
In each row, insert filler text inside a div, and a small image inside a separate div (These two divs should be nested inside the “row” div!)
Provide these divs with a class name that will identify whether they are text or an image
(The second row should have the image FIRST, since the image will be on the left of the text)
You can alternatively provide three paragraphs of information on your artist from their wikipedia page or their professional website
